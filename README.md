# `api-gateway` formula

This repository contains instructions for installing and configuring the `api-gateway`
project.

This repository should be structured as any Saltstack formula should, but it 
should also conform to the structure required by the [builder](https://github.com/elifesciences/builder) 
project.

See the eLife [builder example project](https://github.com/elifesciences/builder-example-project)
for a reference on how to integrate with the `builder` project.
